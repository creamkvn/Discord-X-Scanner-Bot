Discord-X-Scanner-Bot

This code is designed to scan through a given Twitter/X account and post all new posts by the account into a selected Discord server channel

Unfortunately, as of right now, it is not possible to access the necessary Twitter/X API without a premium developer subscription on Twitter/X
